The analysis provided shows a breakdown of school data from 15 schools and compares the results of the students from years 7 to 12 in reading and maths. 

The data has been categorised and sorted in ways that will help the school board and mayor make strategic spending ffor school budgets and priorities. 

One thing that the data suggests is that higher performing schools are generally independent schools, however, this is not in all cases. Some Government schools still
scored in the top 5 performing school, which shows that government school are still effective in teaching reaching/maths in all years.

One strong correlation between the data is that smaller schools typically have better performance amoung students. This can be seen in the Scores by School Size table.
I would suggest that schools with less students will generally yeild better performing students.
